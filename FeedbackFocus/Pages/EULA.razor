    <h1>End User License Agreement (EULA)</h1>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
        By downloading, installing, or using FeeFo ("the Software"), you agree to be bound by this End User License Agreement ("EULA").
        If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the Software.
    </p>

    <h2>2. License Grant</h2>
    <p>
        FeeFo grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Software for personal or educational purposes.
        This license does not allow you to:

        <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software.</li>
        <li>Remove or alter any proprietary notices or labels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. API Usage</h2>
    <p>
        The Software relies on the Hugging Face API for certain functionalities. By default, FeeFo provides access to the Hugging Face API at no cost to the user.
        Alternatively, you may register for your own API key with Hugging Face and enter it into the Software.
    </p>
    <p>
        By using the Software, you agree to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Comply with any rate limits or fair use policies implemented within the Software or by Hugging Face.</li>
        <li>Refrain from excessive, abusive, or malicious use of the API, which may result in suspension of access to these features.</li>
        <li>Accept responsibility for fees or charges incurred if you opt to use your own Hugging Face API key.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        FeeFo reserves the right to restrict or terminate access to the API-based features if abuse or misuse is detected, regardless of whether you use the default API access or your own key.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Revocation of License</h2>
    <p>
        FeeFo reserves the right to revoke your access to the Software or its features at any time, for any reason, including but not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Violations of this EULA.</li>
        <li>Excessive or abusive API usage.</li>
        <li>Actions that compromise the integrity, functionality, or reputation of FeeFo or its associated services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You acknowledge that FeeFo's decision to revoke access is final and not subject to dispute.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The Software processes user data locally on your device. Any data sent to the Hugging Face API for analysis is transmitted securely and is not stored by FeeFo.
        You agree to allow the Software to send necessary data to third-party services for the sole purpose of performing its intended functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
        THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. FEEFO DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR AVAILABILITY OF THE SOFTWARE OR ITS SERVICES.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
